In this task, a feeder is disabled after being activated by beam brake and providin a smoothie. The disabled feeder does not provide a smoothie when beam brake happens unless it is enabled. The feeder is enabled if all bats leave the feeder. According to this experimental design, it is expected that feeders are not too crowded with multiple bats.
