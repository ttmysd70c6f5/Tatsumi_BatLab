The workspaces in this directory will be used for unit testing during the ‘hardware_stream_usb’ and ‘hardware_stream_ethernet’ tests.  To pass each test, hardware must be connected to the computer (either via USB or ethernet). To run all tests, from the command line run:

Trodes test 

To run just these tests, run:

Trodes test hardware_stream_ethernet hardware_stream_usb
