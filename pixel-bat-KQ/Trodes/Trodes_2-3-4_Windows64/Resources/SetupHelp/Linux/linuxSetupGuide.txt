-----------USB setup----------------

If you plan to connect to the ECU over USB (for example to run stateScript
in standalone mode), we need to tell Ubuntu not to 'grab' the device when
it is first plugged in. 

This only needs to be set up once per machine.

1) Open a terminal and run the following commands from the command line
(replace /Path/to/Trodes with the actual path to your Trodes install):

  cd /Path/to/Trodes/Resources/SetupHelp/Linux
  sudo cp spikegadgets.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
  sudo service udev restart

2) Unplug and replug the USB cable connecting your ECU.

You should now be able to start the stateScript module in standalone mode
(by running ./stateScript); click the 'Controller' button, then select 'ECU'
from the dropdown.

—————Ethernet setup————————

Go to ‘Ethernet’ connection settings and set MTU to 9000
Go to the ‘IPv4 Settings’, set address: 192.168.0.2 (anything on this subnet between 2-254 is OK, trodes is .1)
susdNetmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: (leave empty, or use 0.0.0.0)

Adjust the size of the write and receive buffers used by sockets (otherwise Trodes will drop packets, with an error about ‘Lost datapoints’).

edit /etc/sysctl.conf (as root) and add the following lines:

# (Trodes) Increase network buffer sizes
net.core.rmem_max=8388607
net.core.rmem_default=8388607
net.core.wmem_max=8388607
net.core.wmem_default=8388607
