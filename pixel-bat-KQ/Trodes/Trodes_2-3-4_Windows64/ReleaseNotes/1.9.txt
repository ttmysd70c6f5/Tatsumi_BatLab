1.9 Trodes Release Notes

1.9 Major Features

- Data Logger GUI: Updated with a better, more streamlined interface.
    Works with new Dock for faster data extractions, charging station, and streaming.

- RF connected device panel: Our new Dock streams DIO/analog like an MCU, and can also
    connect to a data logger wirelessly! When connected in Trodes, an RF panel shows up
    that displays details about the connected data logger, including # of channels, SD
    capacity, battery remaining, and more.

- RMS plot: Plots root-mean-sq of each hardware channel. Useful for noise debugging

- Power spectral density plot: Density plot of frequencies of a selected ntrode's signal. Useful for noise debugging.

- Allied Vision cameras: Using Bayer8 image format (can be set in their VimbaViewer software),
    your video frame rate can improve by as much as 2x, because CameraModule now supports Bayer8
    to normal RGB24 conversion.
        - Thanks to Tom and Abhilasha from the Frank Lab!

- Updated internal streaming and processing code to be more efficient
